# Reinforcement Learning Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating reinforcement learning concepts, specifically focusing on solving a control task using Deep Q-Learning (DQN). The notebook implements a neural network-based approach for training an agent to interact with an environment.

## Features

- **Environment Setup**: Uses OpenAI Gym for creating a simulation environment.
- **Deep Q-Learning**: Implements the DQN algorithm for training the agent.
- **Neural Network**: Uses PyTorch to build and train a neural network model.
- **Visualization**: Provides performance plots and in-notebook visualizations of the training process.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- PyTorch
- OpenAI Gym
- Matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install numpy torch gym matplotlib
```

## Structure

1. **Introduction**: Explanation of the problem and the reinforcement learning algorithm.
2. **Environment Initialization**: Sets up the OpenAI Gym environment.
3. **Deep Q-Learning Implementation**:
   - Defines the neural network architecture.
   - Implements the DQN algorithm.
   - Handles experience replay for efficient training.
4. **Training the Agent**: Runs multiple episodes, logging rewards and updating the Q-network.
5. **Results and Analysis**: Displays training performance and evaluates the trained agent.

## Running the Notebook

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```
3. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook reinforcement_learning.ipynb
   ```
4. Execute the cells sequentially to train and evaluate the agent.

## Results

The notebook outputs:
- Plots showing the reward trend over episodes.
- Trained agent's performance in the environment.

## Customization

- **Hyperparameters**: You can modify the hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, discount factor, etc.) defined in the notebook to experiment with different setups.
- **Environment**: Replace the default environment with another Gym environment to test the agent on different tasks.
